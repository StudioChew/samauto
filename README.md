# samauto
 i made this because i got tired of typing sam

# how do i run it?
 easy. drag and drop samauto.bat to your sam folder.

# i cannot run it!
 try using a windows virtual machine, with the windows version of sam.

# it tells me that "sam" isnt a command.
 drag it in your sam folder. if you dont have sam, get it from here: https://simulationcorner.net/index.php?page=sam

# why did you make this?
 because i am lazy

# So, How do i customize it?
 easy. First, fork this. Then, Go into the batch file. there is a comment that will tell you what to change.
